* Modified version (STEP_3). performance improvement. Modification between 
different subroutines
        Merging subroutine                                   
        * equili + collis --> collis                         
        * hydrovar1 + hydrovar2 --> hydrovarPRE              
        * hydrovar1 + media     --> hydrovarPOST             
        * splitted force between hydrovarPRE and collis   

Suggested exercises: 

Exercise 1:

Profile the code with gprof: where are you spending more time?
...
make FIX=-pg
./muphase.x
gprof muphase.x


Exercise 2: 

Check performance using different size. Are performance decreasing increasing size?
