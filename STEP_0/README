* Modified version (STEP_0). No performance improveend done. Only "cleaning" the original code
   	* cleaning code                           
   	* different files for different subroutines
        * removing unused arrays                 
        * instrumenting for timing and Mlups    
        * created simple makefile         
	* removed "debug" stabdard output

To compile

* deafult compiling
make 

* forcing a different compiler  (e.g. ifort)
make FC=ifort

* forcing a different flag  (e.g. -Ofast)
make FOPT=-Ofast

* adding a different flag  (e.g. -pg)
make FIX=-pg

To visualize

use gnuplot and load movie_2d.bgk
...
gnuplot> i=0
gnuplot> l 'movie_2D.bgk'


Suggested exercises: 

Exercise 1: 

Profile the code with gprof: where are you spending more time? 
...
make FIX=-pg 
./muphase.x
gprof muphase.x


Exercise 2: 

How change performance (i.e. total time) with different compiler flags? 
(try -O0, -O1, -O2, -Ofast, for gfortran)

Exercise 3:
How increase total time with different sizes? 
(try  96^2, 128^2, 192^2, 512^2,.... You have to modifiy in muphase.par and re-compile the code)
