* Modified version (STEP_1). Some performance improve done: all at single subroutine level, in details 
        * merging loop                 
        * removing unecessary operations
        * unrolling loop                 
        * modified subroutines:           
             * force      
             * move        
             * collis       
             * hydrovar1    
             * hydrovar2
