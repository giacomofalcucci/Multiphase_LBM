Modified version (STEP_1). 
Performance improvement done. All at single subroutine level, in details: 
        * merging loop                 
        * removing unecessary operations
        * unrolling loop                 
        * modified these subroutines:           
             * force      
             * move        
             * collis       
             * hydrovar1    
             * hydrovar2     

* Now diagnostic (1D and 2D) are done only once, at t=10'000

Exercise 1: 

Check performance using different compilers. How change performance whit respect to STEP_0?
