Original version, use only as a reference ad to understand how the code works in its original version (the development one).
* the initial condition is for many bubble (Case 2). For a Single central bubble remove comments to Case 1 and comment line for Case 2.


* To compile:
gfortran -O2  muphase.f -o muphase.x

* To visualize/verify: 
use gnuplot and load movie_2d.bgk
...
gnuplot> i=0
gnuplot> l 'movie_2D.bgk'
...

(you can plot total velocity un-commenting some lines in movie_2D.bgk file)

* To clean the directory (removing all output files)
./clean.sh
